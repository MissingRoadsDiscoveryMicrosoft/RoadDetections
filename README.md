## FAQ

#### What is the GeoJson format?
GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. 
For Intensive Documentation and Tutorials, Refer to [GeoJson Blog](http://geojson.org/)

#### Creation Details:
The road extraction is done in four stages (first dataset went through two stages and second went through all four):
1.	Semantic Segmentation â€“ Recognizing road pixels on the aerial image using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
2.	Geometry Generation - A series of algorithms and processes transforming output of semantic segmentation into roads in geometry format.
3.  Conflation & Cutting - Excluding roads and parts of roads that already exist in the road network (OSM).
4.  Classification - A classifier to filter out low-confidence roads and predict a road type.

### Scheme
![](/images/scheme.png)

#### CNN architecture
Our network was based on UNet and ResNet and the following papers [U-Net] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597), [Res U-Net] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), [Res U-Net] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10684.pdf).
The model was trained on 512x512 images, it is fully-convolutional, meaning that the model can be applied to an image of any size (constrained by GPU memory, 1088x1088 in our case).

#### Training details
The training set consists of 20000 labeled images. Majority of the satellite images cover diverse residential areas all around the world. For the sake of good set representation, we have enriched the set with samples from various areas covering mountains, glaciers, forests, deserts, beaches, coasts, etc.
Images in the set are of 1088x1088 pixel size with 1 meter/pixel resolution. The training is done with Keras toolkit.

#### Metrics
We measure intermediate stage metrics to track performance of our models. <i>Pixel metric</i> measures performance of the the Convolutional Neural Network and <i><a href='https://medium.com/the-downlinq/spacenet-road-detection-and-routing-challenge-part-i-d4f59d55bfce'>APLS metric (Average Path Length Similarity)</a></i> measures overall connectivity after geometry generation stage.

| Metric        | Precision    | Recall    |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Pixel|85.24%|82.81%|
|APLS|87.53%|79.33%|

#### Description
Geometry generation consists of the following steps
1. Image postprocessing
2. Thinning
3. Connectivity improvement
4. Graph construction
5. Finalizing road shapes and network quality
6. Stiching road geojsons between neighboring images where needed

#### Data Vintage
The vintage of the roads depends on the vintage of the underlying imagery. Because Bing Imagery is a composite of multiple sources it is difficult to know the exact dates for individual pieces of data.

#### How good are the data?
The Osm Missing Data went through a final classifier to ensure that the precision is at least 95% (90% for USA now - to be updated to 95% in 2022). After classifier filters out potentially bad roads we remeasure the precision and make sure that it is 95% before releasing results

#### Will there be more data coming for other geographies?
Yes, we are working on processing whole world by October-2022

#### Why is the data being released?
Microsoft has a continued interest in supporting a thriving OpenStreetMap ecosystem.
